# TV Show Data Analyzer

**Author**: Ronald Davidson  
**Date**: December 13, 2022  
**Description**: This Python project implements various algorithms to analyze and display information about TV shows based on user input. It includes exception handling to prevent runtime errors and provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

## Features
- **Menu-Driven Interface**: Users can select from multiple options to analyze TV show data.
- **Data Analysis**:
  - Find shows by rating.
  - Find the highest-rated show within a specified year range.
  - Search for a show by title.
  - Calculate the average score for shows with a specific rating.
  - Find shows with a score higher than a given show.
  - Sort and save data by year to a new file.
- **Exception Handling**: Ensures robust input validation to prevent runtime errors.

## How It Works
1. **Data Input**: The program reads TV show data from a file (e.g., CSV) containing columns for title, rating, year, and score.
2. **User Interaction**: Users are prompted to select an option from the menu to perform specific analyses.
3. **Output**: Results are displayed in a formatted table or written to a new file (for sorting).

## Code Structure
- **`openFile()`**: Opens and validates the data file.
- **`getData()`**: Reads data from the file and stores it in lists.
- **`getChoice()`**: Displays the menu and handles user input.
- **`correctChoice()`**: Validates user input for menu choices.
- **`correctRating()`**: Validates user input for ratings.
- **`getYear()`**: Validates user input for years.
- **`findRightShows()`**: Filters shows within a specified year range.
- **`printResults()`**: Displays results for a specific show.
- **`averageScore()`**: Calculates the average score for a given rating.
- **`getValidShow()`**: Validates user input for show titles.
- **`getShowRating()`**: Retrieves the score for a specific show.
- **`createIndexList()`**: Creates an index list for sorting.
- **`dualSort()`**: Sorts data by year while maintaining list integrity.
- **`writeData()`**: Writes sorted data to a new file.
- **`main()`**: Executes the program and handles user interaction.

## Usage
1. Ensure the data file (e.g., `shows.csv`) is in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
